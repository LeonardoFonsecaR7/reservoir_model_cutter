# Reservoir Model Cutter

## Description

The Reservoir Model Cutter is a tool designed to extract a specific portion of a numerical reservoir model generated by CMG software. This application enables users to create a new, smaller version of the reservoir model by providing the necessary input parameters.

## Features

- **Model Selection:** Input the numerical reservoir model generated by CMG software.
  
- **Grid and Properties:** Provide the model grid along with its properties for accurate extraction.

- **Reference Cell Definition:** Define the reference cell that serves as the starting point for the extraction.

- **X and Y Values:** Specify the X and Y values of the cells to cut, creating a customized subset of the original model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have the CMG software-generated numerical reservoir model.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/reservoir-model-cutter.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd reservoir-model-cutter
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python reservoir_model_cutter.py
    ```

2. Follow the on-screen prompts to input the required information:

    - Select the reservoir model file.
    - Provide the model grid and its properties.
    - Define the reference cell.
    - Specify the X and Y values for the cells to cut.

3. The application will generate a new, smaller version of the reservoir model based on the provided parameters.
